### **Introduction**
SBFspot, formerly known as [SMAspot](http://www.sma-spot.de/), is an open source project to get actual and archive data out of an SMA® inverter over Bluetooth or Ethernet (Speedwire®) It works on either Linux ([Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org)) and Windows.

### **What it does**
SBFspot connects via Bluetooth or Ethernet to your SMA® solar/battery inverter and reads Archive Day/Month Power generation, user/installer events and the actual (spot) data. The collected data is stored in a SQL database (SQLite/MySQL/MariaDB) or SMA® compatible .csv files.
A separate service/daemon uploads the collected data to [PVoutput.org](https://pvoutput.org)
