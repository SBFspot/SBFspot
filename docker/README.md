# sbfspot

This Docker Image provides SBFspot, an open source project located at github ([SBFspot on github](https://github.com/SBFspot/SBFspot)).
It includes:

* SBFspot is used to read power generation data from SMAÂ® solar/battery inverters and store it in a database, csv files or send it to an MQTT Broker.
* SBFspotUploadDaemon can read the power data (only if stored in a mysql/mariadb/sqlite database) and transmit it to ([PVoutput.org](https://pvoutput.org/)).

## Prerequisites

To run SBFspot, you must provide a configuration file (SBFspot.cfg) and map it in the container. Please also make a backup of your config as the container edits the file.
To run SBFspotUploadDaemon, you must provide a configuration file (SBFspotUpload.cfg) and map it in the container.

## Caveats

If your Inverters communicate with Bluetooth, you have to start the SBFspot container in the host network (Option --network host, see usage examples below). Thereby every device including Bluetooth devices are mapped to the container.
The bad about this is, that every host-device is also accessible in the container. If someone knows a workaround or besser solution for this, then please let me know.

# Volumes
* /etc/sbfspot => directory for your configuration files
* /var/sbfspot => data directory (for storing csv files or sqlite database file)

The mapped host volumes should be read- and writeable for user with ID 5000 or group with ID 5000, the config files also.

# Environment variables
## General
### ENABLE_SBFSPOT
* **0** => disable SBFspot
* **1** => enable SBFspot to collect power production data from your inverter(s)

### ENABLE_SBFSPOT_UPLOAD
* **0** => disable SBFspotUploadDaemon
* **1** => enable SBFspotUploadDaemon to upload your production data to PVoutput

### SBFSPOT_INTERVAL
* **seconds** => define an interval at which SBFspot should poll your inverter(s) - default 600

### TZ
* **timezone** e.g. Europe/Berlin => Provide your local timezone

List of all time zones can be found on [wikipedias tz database site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), column "TZ database name". 

### DB_STORAGE
If you want to upload your production data to PVoutput, you have to store them in a database. Otherwise, it is optional. Read the paragraph "Database initialization" to setup your DB.

* **sqlite** => use a sqlite database
* **mysql** => use a mysql database 
* **mariadb** => use a mariadb database

### CSV_STORAGE
If you want to store your production data in CSV files, chose this option. You can additionally store your data in a Database and/or publish them through MQTT.

* **0** => do not store csv files
* **1** => store production data in csv files

### MQTT_ENABLE
If you want to publish your production data to an MQTT Broker, chose this option. You can additionally store your data in a Database and/or CSV files.

* **0** => do not publish data
* **1** => publish production data to an MQTT Broker

(If you want to use MQTT, setup the MQTT Options in the SBFspot.cfg file.)

## SBFspot options
The following Options can be used directly as environment variables.
### QUIET
* **1** => no output from SBFspot

### FINQ or alternatively FORCE
* **1** => Inquire the inverter even at night

### SBFSPOT_ARGS
* **List of Args** => if you don't find the needed Option as an Environment Variable, you can pass the Args directly to the SBFSPOT_ARGS Var.
Example: ```SBFSPOT_ARGS="-finq -settime"``` (Separate multiple Args with space)

    Following a list of useable SBFspots Options
    
    ```
    -d#                 Set debug level: 0-5 (0=none, default=2)
    -v#                 Set verbose output level: 0-5 (0=none, default=2)
    -ad#                Set #days for archived daydata: 0-300
                        0=disabled, 1=today (default), ...
    -am#                Set #months for archived monthdata: 0-300
                        0=disabled, 1=current month (default), ...
    -ae#                Set #months for archived events: 0-300
                        0=disabled, 1=current month (default), ...
    -finq               Force Inquiry (Inquire inverter also during the night)
    -q                  Quiet (No output)
    -nocsv              Disables CSV export (Overrules CSV_Export in config)
    -nosql              Disables SQL export
    -sp0                Disables Spot.csv export
    -installer          Login as installer
    -password:xxxx      Installer password
    -loadlive           Use predefined settings for manual upload to pvoutput.org
    -startdate:YYYYMMDD Set start date for historic data retrieval
    -settime            Sync inverter time with host time
    ```
 
## Database initialization
### INIT_DB
* **0** => normal Operation (poll Inverter and / or upload Data to PVoutput)
* **1** => initialize Database

If you choose ```sqlite``` in the ```DB_STORAGE``` variable, a new database file under /var/sbfspot will be created and set up.

If you choose ```mysql``` or ```mariadb```, a connection to the DB Server configured in SBFspot.cfg will be opened and a SBFspot database and user created. (You have to setup your user and DB Connection in ```SBFspot.cfg```.)

### DB_ROOT_USER
* **username** => provide root username to your mysql/mariadb database (or the username of an user with grants for creating a new database and adding a new user)

### DB_ROOT_PW
* **password** => root password

After the Database is set up, please delete the three database initialization variables. For security reasons, normal operation is prohibited, if administrative accounts are provided.
